STEPS TO USE THE EXECUTABLE:

0.) OPEN JAR FILE (LIKE AN EXE) NAMED "DefinitelyNotAreaSketch=)"

1.) ON RIGHT PANEL, SELECT TYPE OF STRUCTURE(S) YOU WANT TO CREATE, MULTIPLE STRUCTURE TYPES CAN BE CREATED AT ONCE.
2.) CLICK CREATE BUTTON.
3.) A DOT WILL APPEAR ON DRAWING SCREEN WHERE YOU CAN BEGIN TO DRAW BY DRAGGING THE LINES. THE DOT IS PLACED RANDOMLY FOR NOW, SO SOMETIMES IT WILL PLACE IT IN A POOR POSITION.

4.) WHEN STRUCTURE IS CLOSED, AREA WILL BE CALCULATED AND DISPLAYED.
5.) TO SAVE YOUR DRAWING TO AN XML FILE: TOOLBAR -> FILE -> SAVE -> 'FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ON POPUP'
6.) TO OPEN AN EXISTING XML FILE (MUST BE OF THIS FORMAT): TOOLBAR -> FILE -> OPEN -> 'FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ON POPUP'

*THE REST OF THE FILES ARE JAVA CLASSES.
